9-28:
Local github repo created.
Video is also recorded

Hopefully I will be less busy this week so I can get more done for next week.
I am also thinking of creating one big video. Tbh I think this will be for the best, however I will still go about this in a three part format.
I have all the tools installed to do this now, all I need to do is do it.

TODO:
Create final version of first video/First Part
Find a way of settig certian files to be unreadable by people who do not have previleges AKA everyone but me and Greg.
